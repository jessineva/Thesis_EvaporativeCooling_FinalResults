   ** Warning ** This building has no thermal mass which can cause an unstable solution.
   **   ~~~   ** Use Material object for all opaque material definitions except very light insulation layers.
   ** Warning ** ComputeIntSWAbsorbFactors: Sum of area times inside solar absorption for all surfaces is zero in Zone: NCAFETERIA
   ** Warning ** GetUserConvectionCoefficients: SurfaceProperty:ConvectionCoefficients:MultipleSurface, for Surface Type=ALLINTERIORSURFACES
   **   ~~~   ** Convection Coefficient 2 Location is blank and rest of fields will not be processed.
   ** Warning ** Zone areas*inside surface emissivities are summing to zero, for Zone="NCAFETERIA"
   **   ~~~   ** As a result, MRT will be set to MAT for that zone
