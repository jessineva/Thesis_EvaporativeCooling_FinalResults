   ** Warning ** This building has no thermal mass which can cause an unstable solution.
   **   ~~~   ** Use Material object for all opaque material definitions except very light insulation layers.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 1 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** ComputeIntSWAbsorbFactors: Sum of area times inside solar absorption for all surfaces is zero in Zone: NCAFETERIA
   ** Warning ** GetUserConvectionCoefficients: SurfaceProperty:ConvectionCoefficients:MultipleSurface, for Surface Type=ALLINTERIORSURFACES
   **   ~~~   ** Convection Coefficient 2 Location is blank and rest of fields will not be processed.
   ** Warning ** Zone areas*inside surface emissivities are summing to zero, for Zone="NCAFETERIA"
   **   ~~~   ** As a result, MRT will be set to MAT for that zone

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
